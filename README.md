# dockerFiles
As a technical exersice I have created some dockerfiles. Each directory has each own purpose.
buildstreet is a jenkins, with sonaqube and nexus(probably)
underConstruction is an nginx loadbalancer and a static http container, which can be scaled. This is no more that a simple hello world
